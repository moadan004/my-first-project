            <p>Once upon a time, there was a kind and hardworking farmer named Jack who lived in a small village. He lived a simple life and was content with what he had. However, one day, a great drought hit the land and all of the crops withered and died.
                The villagers were left without food and began to worry about how they would survive the winter</p>
